# Nuvix v2 — Bun-Native Rewrite Plan

> **Status**: PLANNING → EXECUTION
> **Scope**: Full rewrite of the Nuvix backend from NestJS/Fastify/Node to a
> Bun-native stack built on Elysia (`elysia@next`). This is a **rewrite**, not
> a mechanical migration.
> **Location**: Everything lives in `next/`. Root monorepo stays untouched and
> runnable until cutover, then it is deleted.

## 0. Philosophy

**The old codebase is a REFERENCE, not a BLUEPRINT.**

| Old code tells us              | Old code does NOT tell us             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| What the product does          | How to structure folders/files        |
| What routes/features exist     | What to name functions or params      |
| Business rules & edge cases    | Which patterns to keep                |
| Where the hard-won logic lives | The API contract (we're designing v2) |

We are building the **next version**: APIs improve, structure improves,
architecture improves. Every structural decision is made fresh, optimized for
testability, readability, and Bun-native performance — never copied from the
old tree out of convenience.

---

## 1. Ground Rules

### ✅ What we FOLLOW

1. **Bun-native first.** Before any dependency, check Bun builtins:
   - `Bun.sql` / `SQL` — Postgres · `Bun.redis` — Redis
   - `Bun.password` — argon2id/bcrypt · `Bun.file` / `Bun.write` — files
   - `Bun.crypto` / `crypto.subtle` — HMAC, JWT, tokens, MD5 legacy
   - `Bun.spawn`, `Bun.sleep`, `Bun.env`, `bun test`
     File handling, hashing, HTTP, scheduling — all through Bun natives.
2. **Elysia idioms.** Lifecycle hooks (`onRequest/onParse/onBeforeHandle/
onError`), typed context via `derive`/`resolve`, `t` (TypeBox) schemas,
   plugin composition. No framework fighting.
3. **Contract-first per module.** Before porting a domain, write its v2 API
   contract (routes, schemas, errors) in `docs/api/<module>.md`, review it,
   then implement. Implementation without a reviewed contract doesn't start.
4. **Vertical slices.** One domain = one self-contained folder with co-located
   route + schema + service + tests (see §4).
5. **Structure as you go.** Never copy old file organization. Extract pure,
   testable functions; keep handlers thin; services own business logic.
6. **Pin exact versions** of `elysia@next` (beta) and plugins in `bun.lock`.
7. **Reference, don't trust.** When implementing business logic, read the old
   service code to learn the _rules_ (e.g. session expiry semantics, bucket
   permission inheritance), then implement cleanly in the new shape.

### ❌ What we DON'T follow

1. **Old tests are NOT truth.** AI-generated slop, outdated. Not ported, not
   trusted. New tests are written fresh against the v2 contracts.
2. **No NestJS patterns.** No DI container, decorators, modules,
   reflect-metadata, rxjs, class-validator/class-transformer.
3. **No Node compatibility shims.** Bun-only runtime (D8).
4. **No copying of naming.** Function names, param names, DTO names, file
   layouts from the old repo are not carried over unless genuinely good.
5. **Don't touch root monorepo.** It stays runnable as a live reference.

Fully typed paths/responses/errors generated from the Elysia instance                   | Compile-time route safety; one client pattern everywhere; error bodies typed via `error.value`                |
| D31 | **TypeScript**              | TypeScript 7.0.2 (Go-native compiler, stable). Verified: full workspace typechecks clean incl. Elysia generics; ~0.2s for the repo                                                                        | Bun transpiles anyway — tsc is typecheck-only here, so native compiler is pure win; revisit if issues surface |
| D32 | **i18n scope & engine**     | Everything localized (errors, emails, SMS, locale data) via **ICU MessageFormat** (`intl-messageformat`) in `packages/i18n`; assets stay flat dot-key JSON at `assets/locale/translations/`               | 73 locales migrated to ICU by script; see `docs/api/_i18n.md`                                                 |
| D33 | **Typed translation keys**  | `TranslationKey` union generated from `en.json` (`bun run generate:keys` in `packages/i18n`); unknown keys are compile errors                                                                             | Per-key param-type inference dropped (ICU) — params are a plain record, verified by tests                     |
| D34 | **Locale resolution**       | `x-nuvix-locale` header > user pref (future hook) > `Accept-Language` (q-values) > `en`; exposed on context as `locale` via `'plugin'`-scoped derive; error `messageKey` translated at serialization time | English `detail` always present as fallback; translation failures never mask the original error               |
| D35 | **GeoIP graceful degradation** | Bundled dbip `.mmdb`; missing asset → no-op provider (lookups `null`), `/v2/locale` serves unknown-IP shape, warn once at boot — never fails startup | Full DNS-pinned SSRF guards + Redis-cached lookups deferred to hardening pass |
| D36 | **Avatar caching**          | Static avatars/QR: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400, immutable`; favicon proxy: `max-age=3600` NOT immutable (remote content changes); favicon gets SSRF guard (http(s) only, private-host literals rejected, image/* content-type required) — v1 had no cache header and no guard | QR `Content-Disposition: inline` by default, `attachment` with `download=true` |

### Elysia 2 API notes (code against THESE from day one)

Elysia 2 is a complete rewrite with breaking changes. We never write Elysia-1-style code:

| Elysia 1.x                                                                         | Elysia 2 (`elysia@next`)                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.get('/', handler, { body: t.Object({...}) })`                                    | `.get('/', { body: t.Object({...}) }, handler)` — **options BEFORE handler**                 |
| `onRequest / onParse / onBeforeHandle / onAfterHandle / onAfterResponse / onError` | `request / parse / beforeHandle / afterHandle / afterResponse / error` (`on` prefix dropped) |
| `resolve()` (ran at beforeHandle)                                                  | **removed** — `derive()` now runs at beforeHandle                                            |
| `.error('Code', Class)` + error dictionary                                         | `.error(MyErrorClass, handler)` — class-based, fully inferred                                |
| Custom error envelopes                                                             | RFC 9457 via `problem(status, {...})` + `application/problem+json`                           |
| `.ws()` always available                                                           | opt-in: `.use(websocket())` from `elysia/websocket`; generator handlers (`yield`) preferred  |
| guard/group additive schemas                                                       | default **override**; pass `schema: 'standalone'` explicitly when needed                     |
| `{ as: 'scoped' }`                                                                 | string scope form: `.guard('plugin', fn)` etc.                                               |
| JIT compile at request time                                                        | optional **AOT build plugin**: `import { aot } from 'elysia/plugin/aot/bun'` in `Bun.build`  |
| `@elysiajs/*` plugins                                                              | new official scope is **`@elysia`** for 2.x plugins (`@elysiajs` stays 1.x)                  |

Also useful: `defer(fn)` for post-response work (audit/stats side-effects),
per-field cookie schemas with signing, `Manifest.isCapturing()` to skip
long-running connections during AOT dry-run.

### Bun 1.4 natives we adopt

| Need                                   | Bun builtin                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Image processing (avatars, thumbnails) | `Bun.Image` (D21)                             |
| Scheduled jobs                         | `Bun.cron` (D22)                              |
| Files/storage local driver             | `Bun.file`, `Bun.write`, `Bun.s3.*`           |
| Hashing/tokens/JWT                     | `Bun.crypto`, `crypto.subtle`, `Bun.password` |
| SQL / Redis                            | `Bun.sql`, `Bun.redis`                        |
| Tarballs/archives (backups, exports)   | `Bun.Archive`                                 |
| Config files                           | `Bun.JSON5`, TOML/YAML utils                  |

## 5. Execution Phases

> Each module follows the same loop:
> **design contract → review → implement → bun test → manual smoke vs old behavior**

### Phase 0 — Scaffolding

- [x] `next/` monorepo: workspaces, tsconfig, biome, env loader (`packages/utils/src/config.ts`, fail-fast validation)
- [x] Pin `elysia@next` exact version (**2.0.0-beta.6**); smoke-test boot + `/v2/health` ✅
- [x] Define **API conventions** in `docs/api/_conventions.md`: RFC 9457 problem+json errors (D19), pagination (D27), ID scheme (D28), versioning/prefix (D26), auth header names (see §7 Open Questions)
- [x] Port config module into `packages/utils`
- [x] Error classes + `problemErrors` plugin mapping `AppError` → RFC-9457 (tested)

**Elysia 2.0.0-beta.6 API notes** (verified against installed source, not docs):

- `.onError` does NOT exist — error handling is `.error(ErrorClass, handler)` or `.error('global'|'plugin'|'local', Class, handler)`
- Error handlers registered inside a plugin MUST use `'global'` scope or they silently don't propagate to the consuming instance
- Native RFC-9457 support: built-in `problem(status, detail)` helper; framework already emits problem+json for 404/validation/etc. Built-in errors: `NotFound`, `ParseError`, `ValidationError` (422), `InternalServerError`, all extending `ElysiaError` with `problemType`/`problemTitle`
- Bun 1.4 uses the isolated linker by default → workspace deps live under `<pkg>/node_modules`, not hoisted to root
- Route signature is options-before-handler: `.get(path, { response: t.Object({...}) }, handler)`

### Phase 1 — Core pipeline skeleton

- [x] Typed error classes + problem+json envelope (done early in Phase 0 — `apps/server/src/shared/errors.ts` + `plugins/errors.ts`)
- [x] Auth resolution primitives: JWT util (`utils/jwt.ts`, zero-dep HS256 on `crypto.subtle`), auth context (`context/auth.ts`: guest/session/jwt/apiKey union, pluggable DB-backed verifiers for later phases; precedence session > jwt > key > guest)
- [x] CORS (`plugins/cors.ts`, hand-rolled), security headers (`plugins/security.ts`), rate limiting (`plugins/rate-limit.ts`, pluggable `Store`; memory impl now, Redis drops in later) — all tested
- [ ] Context chain: project resolution (internal vs project DB via new `@nuvix/db`), console/admin modes — deferred until `@nuvix/db` is wired
- [x] OpenAPI docs via `@elysia/openapi@2.0.0-beta.1` (D10) — spec at `/v2/openapi/json` (typed from `t` schemas), Scalar UI at `/v2/openapi`. **Requires a Bun patch** (`patches/@elysia+openapi@2.0.0-beta.1.patch`): the published bundle has broken relative `../node_modules/typebox` imports in its `gen` submodule; the patch stubs `Script` (only used by `fromTypes()`, which we don't use). Root `package.json` also carries `elysia` so the patched copy resolves it under Bun's isolated linker. Defaults differ from v1 plugin: spec path is `/openapi/json` (not `/openapi.json`), UI is Scalar (not Swagger).

**Phase 1 notes (verified against elysia 2.0.0-beta.6 source):**

- `onRequest` does NOT exist → the hook is `.request(fn)` (matches §2 table, but confirmed in practice: this is exactly why `@elysiajs/cors@1.x` crashes)
- `derive` inside a plugin needs explicit scope to cross `.use()` boundaries: `.derive('plugin', fn)`; local-scoped derive silently doesn't propagate (same class of bug as error handlers needing `'global'`)
- **Plugin factories MUST be invoked before `.use()`**: `.use(plugin(opts))` works, but `.use(plugin)` (bare function reference) silently drops the returned instance's `'global'`-scoped error handlers — requests fall through to default error handling. Mutator-style plugins (`fn(app)` that calls `.request()`/`.derive()` on the passed instance) are unaffected. Verified empirically against 2.0.0-beta.6
- **Route signature is `.get(path, hook, handler)`** — the schema/hook object comes BEFORE the handler (v1 Elysia had handler second). Passing `(path, handler, hook)` does not error: the hook object is treated as the handler and gets JSON-serialized as the response body (`{"query":{...}}`), and the real function is registered as a hook. Every route in a module silently returns its own schema. Caught via treaty 404/shape mismatches; verified with minimal repro
- **Returning a `Response` instance from a handler breaks when any hook object is present** — even `{}` — the Response gets stringified. Binary endpoints must return bytes (`Uint8Array`) and set `content-type` etc. via `set.headers` instead
- **`query`/`headers`/etc. in hooks must be a single TypeBox schema** (`t.Object({...})`); a plain object-of-schemas fails at route-compile time with "Elysia Validator support only TypeBox and Standard Schema" (500 on first request, not at registration)
- **Async derives MUST be awaited inside the derive fn**: `.derive('plugin', ({req}) => ({ locale: getTranslator(...) }))` leaves a bare `Promise` on context — first consumer crashes with `locale.format is not a function`. Latent until a route actually reads the value; use `.derive('plugin', async (...) => ({ locale: await ... }))`
- **Derives don't flow through TYPES across separate plugin instances**: `localeRoutes()` mounted after `localeContext()` sees `locale` at runtime but TS doesn't. Self-contained modules should own their derive (accept `LocaleContextOptions`, derive internally) for full inference
- **`context.ip` is not auto-populated** in beta.6 — resolve client IP manually: `x-forwarded-for` header first, else `server?.requestIP(request)?.address`
- **Eden treaty dynamic segments take the VALUE as property**: `client.v2.avatars.flags.us.get()`, NOT `.get({ params: { code: 'us' } })` (the latter sends the literal `:code` path)
- Async error handlers + returning `problem(status, {...})` from them work correctly (unwrapped to problem+json on both route and error handler paths)
- Async `derive` works fine (returns `MaybePromise`)
- No `Bun.JWT` API exists in Bun 1.4 → JWT stays hand-rolled HS256 on `crypto.subtle` (D6 confirmed)

### Phase 2 — First vertical slice: Locale + Avatars

- [x] i18n foundation (D32–D34): `packages/i18n` (loader/translator/resolver, 12 tests), ICU migration of all 73 locale files + round-trip tests, typed-key codegen, `context/locale.ts` derive, error `messageKey` plumbing in `AppError`/`problemErrors`. Contract: `docs/api/_i18n.md`
- [x] Write v2 contracts for both modules → review (approved; `docs/api/locale.md`, `docs/api/avatars.md`)
- [x] Implement Locale + Avatars (`apps/server/src/locale`, `apps/server/src/avatars`); Bun.Image replaces sharp (D21), resvg only for initials SVG→PNG, assets copied to `next/assets/{avatars,fonts,dbip}`. 25 module tests, treaty-based. **v1 bug fixed:** `eu` was always `false` in v1 (`euList` holds country codes but was checked against `continentCode`); v2 checks the country code
- [x] Smoke-test harness (`apps/server/test/smoke/`): declarative behavioral cases run against the REAL composed app via `app.handle()`; set `NUVIX_V1_BASE_URL` to also replay each case against a live old app and print a normalized parity report (informational — v2 assertions are the hard contract). 17 cases seeded for locale/avatars/errors

### Phase 3 — Data services

- [x] Contracts drafted for review: `docs/api/database.md` (schemas CRUD only — collections/documents deferred until `@nuvix/db` stabilizes), `docs/api/teams.md` (incl. invite/accept lifecycle), `docs/api/users.md` (**legacy hash-create endpoints dropped per D29** — md5/sha/phpass/scrypt variants not carried over)
- [ ] Implement database service on new `@nuvix/db`
- [ ] Teams, Users slices
- [ ] Schemas slice — minus `@nuvix/pg`-dependent endpoints (deferred list in `DEFERRED_ROUTES.md`)

### Phase 4 — Account/Auth (highest risk)

- [ ] Contract first: sessions, MFA, recovery, OAuth2, JWT/API-key issuance
- [ ] Password hashing: bcrypt/argon2 only — legacy algos (MD5 etc.) NOT supported per D29
- [ ] MFA: decide otplib vs hand-rolled RFC-6238 (gate: validated against real factors)

### Phase 5 — Storage + Messaging + Webhooks

- [ ] Storage: buckets/files, `Bun.file` local driver + S3 driver, uploads via Elysia `t.File`
- [ ] Messaging: topics/subscribers/providers, Handlebars templates kept
- [ ] Webhooks

### Phase 6 — Async jobs

- [ ] BullMQ over Bun adapter: audits, batch, deletes, logs, mails, messaging, stats
- [ ] Cron scheduler on `Bun.sleep` loop
- [ ] Typed event emitter

### Phase 7 — Platform app

- [ ] Platform slices (projects, keys, templates, auth-settings, metadata)
- [ ] pg-meta introspection over `Bun.sql`

### Phase 8 — Local `@nuvix/pg` replacement (D12)

- [ ] Design `DataSource` surface from ACTUAL usage (query builder, joins, raw SQL, metadata, logs)
- [ ] Implement on `Bun.sql` in `packages/` ; re-enable deferred endpoints
- [ ] Full API surface audit vs `docs/api/*`

### Phase 9 — Tests & cutover

- [ ] Complete fresh suite: unit (co-located) + integration + e2e (`bun test`)
- [ ] Perf baseline vs old app
- [ ] Docker/deploy artifacts for Bun-only runtime
- [ ] Delete root monorepo (**explicit approval gate**)

## 6. `@nuvix/pg` Deferral Strategy

Old usage sites (reference only):

```
core.service.ts, schema.hook.ts, logs.queue.ts        ← DataSource creation/writes
pg-meta.service.ts                                     ← introspection
query/builder.ts, query/join-builder.ts               ← query building
schemas.service.ts (Raw SQL), database.service.ts     ← data services
platform metadata.service.ts                           ← platform
```

**Rules during Phases 1–7:**

- No `@nuvix/pg` imports anywhere in `next/`.
- Endpoints requiring it are excluded from their module's v2 contract and
  tracked in `DEFERRED_ROUTES.md`.
- `packages/utils` query builders define a minimal `DataSource` interface so
  the future local implementation drops in without touching call sites.

## 6b. Multi-Tenancy Architecture (D20)

The old system was _partially_ multi-tenant (schema separation, shared pools).
v2 makes tenancy **structural**:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────────────┐
                    │  platform app               │
                    │  creates projects/tenants,  │
                    │  provisions their DBs       │
                    └──────────┬──────────────────┘
                               │ provision
        ┌──────────┬───────────┼───────────┬──────────┐
        ▼          ▼           ▼           ▼
   tenant DB A  tenant DB B  tenant DB C  …          ← one Postgres database
   (pg 18)      (pg 18)      (pg 18)                 per project, custom image
                                                     nuvix-dev/postgres
        ▲          ▲           ▲
        └──────────┴───────────┘
                   │ routed by resolved tenant context
            ┌──────┴──────┐
            │ server app  │  every request resolves: API key / token
            └─────────────┘  → project → tenant DB connection
```

**Rules:**

1. **One database per tenant/project.** No shared-schema tenancy in v2.
2. The **platform app owns provisioning**: creating the project record,
   creating its database (via the pg-18 image's auto-schema bootstrap),
   tracking connection metadata in the internal/platform DB.
3. The **server app never hardcodes tenants**: each request resolves
   `credentials → project → tenant DB handle` through the typed context chain.
4. Connection management: pooled per-tenant handles with LRU eviction +
   optional pooler (pgcat) — design lives in `packages/core` (`tenants/`).
5. Schema/collection model inside a tenant DB is **redesigned freely** (D25) —
   the pg-18 image's auto-schema features are the foundation; consult
   github.com/nuvix-dev/postgres when designing.
6. Platform-side features that depend on provisioning (billing, quotas,
   region placement) are **explicitly out of scope for now** — interfaces are
   stubbed so they can be added later without rework.

## 7. Open Questions (decide before/at each gate)

Tracked here so nothing gets decided silently:

**Resolved:**

1. ✅ **API prefix** → `/v2` (D26)
2. ✅ **Pagination** → cursor-based primary, offset where impractical; all list responses carry `meta` (D27)
3. ✅ **IDs** → keep existing scheme; port the ID helper (wraps `@nuvix/db` ID) (D28)
4. ✅ **Legacy compat** → dropped entirely: no legacy data migration, no MD5/legacy password algos, no session survival across cutover (D29)
5. ✅ **SVG avatars** → keep `@resvg/resvg-js` for now; revisit a zero-dep custom SVG rasterizer later
6. ✅ **Auth at launch** → token-ready design (D23); final call on shipping tokens vs sessions at Phase 4 gate

**Still open:**

7. **TOTP** — hand-rolled RFC-6238 on `crypto.subtle` vs keep otplib. _(Phase 4)_
8. **Realtime/WebSocket** — Elysia 2's generator-based `.ws()`; in v2 core scope or post-v2? _(after Phase 3)_
9. **Auth header names** — keep `x-nuvix-session`/`x-nuvix-key` or rename in v2. _(Phase 1, contract design)_

## 8. Risk Register

| Risk                                   | Mitigation                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `elysia@next` beta churn/bugs          | Pin exact; isolate framework glue in `app.ts`/plugins; track changelog between phases |
| BullMQ Bun adapter immaturity          | Thin queue interface; swap adapter only if broken                                     |
| Business-rule drift during redesign    | Contracts reviewed before impl; old service code read as reference for every rule     |
| Redisigned API breaks SDK expectations | Accept (v2); document breaking changes per module in `docs/api/`                      |
| Scope creep                            | No features beyond defined contracts until Phase 9                                    |
