## Why Nuvix?

Building a modern app means stitching together auth providers, databases, file storage, and messaging services. That's 4+ vendors, 4+ dashboards, and 4+ billing pages before you write a single line of product code.

**Nuvix replaces all of that.** One backend. One API. One permission model. Fully self-hostable.

Whether you're building an **AI-powered SaaS**, a **mobile app**, or an **internal tool**, Nuvix gives you the secure infrastructure to ship fast and scale without limits.

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Security
Multi-tenant auth with user accounts, sessions, teams, and role-based access. Security is not an afterthought; it's built into every layer. Managed schemas auto-generate Row-Level Security policies so your data is locked down from day one.

### 🗄️ Three-Schema Database
PostgreSQL-powered. Pick the right model for each use case:

| Schema | Best For | What You Get |
|---|---|---|
| **Document** | Rapid prototyping, MVPs | NoSQL-style flexibility, zero SQL needed |
| **Managed** | Production apps at scale | Auto-generated CRUD policies, RLS, permission tables |
| **Unmanaged** | Full control, custom logic | Raw SQL, your tables, your views, no restrictions |

Mix and match across a single project. All schemas share one unified API.

### 🤖 AI-Ready Infrastructure
Build AI applications with confidence. Nuvix provides the secure data layer, auth, and storage that AI-powered products need. Store embeddings, manage user sessions, handle file uploads for ML pipelines, and enforce granular permissions on every request.

### 📦 Storage
Permission-aware file system with S3-compatible drivers or local storage. Upload, serve, and manage files with the same permission rules as your database.

### 📬 Messaging
Email, SMS, and push notifications through a single API. Built-in templates and provider integrations so you're not wiring up Sendgrid, Twilio, and Firebase separately.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get running in under 2 minutes:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nuvix-dev/docker.git nuvix
cd nuvix
cp .env.example .env    # Configure your secrets
docker compose up -d
```

Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** and create your first project.

That's it. No complex setup. No 47-step guide.

### Development

```bash
bun install        # Install dependencies
bun run dev        # Start dev server
bun run test       # Run tests
bun run lint       # Lint with Biome
```

**Requirements:** [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) + [Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.3.7

## 🛡️ Security First

Nuvix is designed with a **zero-trust permission model**:

- **Every request** passes through permission checks across database, storage, and messaging
- **Managed schemas** auto-generate Row-Level Security policies, so you don't need to write them by hand
- **Project isolation** keeps tenant data separated at the database level
- **Self-hosted** means your data never leaves your infrastructure

You don't "enable" security in Nuvix. It's the default.
