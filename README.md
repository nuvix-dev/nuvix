**Nuvix is a TypeScript-first backend platform that helps you build secure and scalable applications with less effort. It combines authentication, a powerful multi-schema database, file storage, and messaging into a single, unified system you can self-host anywhere.**

Whether you're building for web, mobile, or server environments, Nuvix gives you a strong backend foundation without boilerplate or complexity.

## What You Get

### ✅ Authentication

Built-in users, sessions, and team management. Designed for secure, multi-tenant applications from day one.

### ✅ Database

A flexible, permission-driven data layer powered by PostgreSQL, featuring the Nuvix **three-schema system**:

#### **1. Document Schemas**

A NoSQL-style model for fast iteration. Define attributes and indexes without writing SQL.

#### **2. Managed Schemas**

Structured PostgreSQL tables enhanced with Nuvix automation:

* Auto-generated CRUD policies
* Automatic Row-Level Security
* Built-in permission tables
* Secure by default

#### **3. Unmanaged Schemas**

Full SQL freedom. Bring your own tables, views, and logic with no restrictions.

All schema types share a consistent API surface and follow the same permission rules.

### ✅ Storage

A simple, permission-aware file system with support for S3-compatible drivers or local storage.

### ✅ Messaging

A unified interface for outbound communication:

* Email
* SMS
* Push notifications

Templates and integrations included.
